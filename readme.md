# ReplicatorG-websocketserver
## MQTT to Web Socket bridge for my ReplicatorG and ReplicatorG-webstatus branches

I wanted the ability to see the status of a 3D print from our Makerbot, so I forked <a href="https://github.com/justinribeiro/ReplicatorG">ReplicatorG</a>, added MQTT support, created a this bridge server, and then built <a href="https://github.com/justinribeiro/ReplicatorG-webstatus">ReplicatorG-webstatus</a> on top.

More info and a live demo is in the <a href="http://justinribeiro.com/chronicle/2012/09/05/getting-makerbot-status-on-the-web-with-mqtt-pywebsocket-eclipse-paho-and-html-5-web-sockets/">blog post</a>.
